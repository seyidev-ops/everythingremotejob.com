# Everything Remote Job — Production Website

This repository contains the current production website for **Everything Remote Job (ERJ)** at **everythingremotejob.com**.

It is a deployment repository, not a changelog. This README describes only the website and commercial structure represented by the files currently in this repository.

## Business

**Everything Remote Job** is a career-outcomes company operated by **Business Play Limited**.

- Brand: Everything Remote Job
- Tagline: **Work Beyond Borders.**
- Primary domain: **everythingremotejob.com**
- WhatsApp: **+234 803 292 5957**
- Core method: **Supply · Representation · Aim · Conversion**
- Primary conversion instruction: **Find your leak.**

The public website combines free diagnostic resources, live training, self-paced learning, done-for-you job application services and private 1:1 support.

## Current first-contact journey

Cold or uncertain visitors should not be asked to choose among ERJ products first. The current acquisition path is:

1. **Your Starting Line** — `starting-line.html` is the default cold-traffic destination for social posts, ads, QR codes, generic learn-more links and first-contact campaigns.
2. **Find Your Leak** — the free Four-Point diagnostic identifies the earliest failing point: Supply, Representation, Aim or Conversion.
3. **Free first action** — the visitor receives a useful next move before any paid recommendation.
4. **AUDIT on WhatsApp** — optional human review when the visitor wants ERJ to inspect the evidence.
5. **Correct ERJ door** — only after diagnosis should the smallest suitable paid route be introduced.
6. **Register/payment** — the register page supports a decision already made; it is not the default first-contact page.

The homepage remains the institutional ERJ ecosystem. Its first screen nevertheless prioritises **Find my leak — free**, with the wider site available as the secondary path.

## CV Engine targeting rule

The CV Builder treats a job description as a **comparison and positioning surface**, not as permission to rewrite employment history. Automatic target alignment may set the professional headline to the advertised role and reorder skills/tools already supplied by the participant. It must not automatically change employers, employment dates, historical job titles, achievement wording or the order of experience bullets. Missing target terms are shown as missing unless the participant explicitly confirms that they genuinely possess the skill/tool.

## Current payment routes

Depending on the product, the website uses:

- Paystack
- Selar
- Business Play Ltd bank transfer confirmed through WhatsApp

For the **₦50,000 Cohort 10 reservation**, the prospect completes the Registrar fit check before receiving/using the bank-transfer route.

## Website structure

The site is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website hosted on **GitHub Pages** with the custom domain defined in `CNAME`.

Key production areas include:

- `/` — main website
- `/register.html` — offer chooser, prices and enrolment
- `/diagnose/` — Four-Point Job Search Diagnostic and branded PDF result
- `/cvscan/` — 10-Point CV Self-Scan
- `/cvbuilder/` — CV Engine / participant CV tooling
- `/foundationtraining/` — live Foundation Training
- `/selflearn/` — self-paced programme
- `/jobapplication/` — Done-For-You Application
- `/innercircle/` — private 1:1 Inner Circle
- `/masterclass/` — Remote Job Application Clinic registration flow
- `/blog.html` — Remote Career Blog archive
- `/testimonials.html` — documented success stories
- `/dashboard.html` — participant dashboard
- `/admin.html` — admin surface
- `/instructor.html` — instructor surface

## Blog publishing

The blog archive follows the **Africa/Lagos (WAT)** daily publication schedule. The archive should expose posts according to their scheduled date rather than simply displaying every pre-generated article file at once.

## Private-content treatment

Participant, admin and instructor surfaces are treated as private operational pages and use search-engine exclusion/no-cache controls where applicable.

Paid participant material carries ERJ licensing/ownership notices and participant-facing resource controls. Public website content remains normal accessible HTML; public pages are not presented as technically “uncopyable.”

## Brand assets

Use the official supplied ERJ artwork. Do not redraw the logo.

Primary masters in this repository:

- `erj-mark-dark.png`
- `erj-mark-light.png`
- `erj-lockup-dark.png`
- `erj-lockup-light.png`

Small interface derivatives such as the 128px marks, favicons and app icons exist only where the website actually uses them.

### Brand system

- Night canvas: `#000000`
- Day canvas: `#FAFAF8`
- Brand orange: `#FF5722`
- Day fill accent: `#E8470F`
- Day small accent text: `#AD350A`
- Display: Space Grotesk
- Body: Inter

## Deployment

This ZIP is intended to be deployed directly to the GitHub Pages repository root.

1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Upload/commit the extracted production files to the repository root.
3. Keep `CNAME` in the root so the custom domain remains attached.
4. Do not add internal campaign notes, historical patch notes, test reports or old versioned deployment files to the public production repository.
5. Keep this `README.md` current when the live commercial structure or production architecture changes.

There is no required build step for ordinary deployment; the repository contains the production-ready static files.

## Production documentation rule

`README.md` is the only production Markdown document required in this package.

It should always describe **what the website is now**. Historical implementation notes, patch records and temporary campaign-working documents belong outside the production repository.
